# PTR Exam

Describe a messaging-based system for the given scenario. Keep in mind such concerns as security, fault-tolerance, and performance (don't forget to mention what performance means for your system). Also depending on your scenario, there might also be domain-dependent requirements. Please describe the assumptions you've made and all the design decisions you took. Important: you can take inspiration from existing solutions but don't try to mimic them.

## V1: A system to collect and analyze sensor data for a smart home (heating, meteo, motion sensors, electricity).

We can assume that a sensor sends data every one second, which means we'll have N messages/second where N is number of sensors. This si not much and won't require any special optimizations. We can also assume that the data is not very big, so we can use JSON as a message format and HTTPS as a transport protocol. Because all the network communication will be happens inside one home, the server will accept requests only from local network, which should simply our security concerns.

If we don't want to lose any messages we can add a message broker between the gateway and analyzers.

## V2: A system to collect sensor data for a car (engine, breaks, media, climate control, cameras).

In case of a car the messages will be more frequent, let's assume each sensor will send one message every 10ms. This means we'll have 100 messages/second for each sensor and we'll also have a lot for redundant sensors, so it's gonna be a lot of messages to process. All communication will run in car's local network so we don't need to worry about security. We'll need a lot of redundancy and high availability. Also asynchronous communication like using a message broker or batching the messages is not an option because we need to know the state of the car in real time. Communication through a gateway could also add extra latency we can't afford. We'll have to eventually store these messages, because there are a lot of them we will batch them before saving to the database.

## V3: An online gaming backend (in-game chat, game state changes/multiplayer, leaderboard).

In this case we'll have a lot of small messages. If 60 fps is a playable frame rate for a game, we could say that we'll need 60 messages/second for each player. If we have 1000 players online we'll have 60 000 messages/second. This is a lot of messages and we'll need to optimize our system. Games also require low latency, so we'll use UDP as transport protocol. To make the game look smother we'll have to make small batches of messages and send them at once. For each game we'll have a separate server where players can connect. For login, leaderboard, and other non-realtime features we'll have a separate server for all players. We also might need to queue the players before they can join a game if there are too many of them.

## V4: A system to collect sensor data for a national electric grid (cable health/status, voltage, current, temperature, consumption).

## V5: A credit offerings search/aggregator service (insert your data, get a list of possible credit options from different banks).

## V6: A machine learning prediction service (High-resolution images, streaming/real time data).

Because the images will be high-resolution we shouldn't pass them as messages. Instead we'll store them in a blob storage and pass the link to the image as message. Because this prediction algorithms could take time, we need a queue to store the requests and process them one by one. Prediction results could be stored in a database.

## V7: A batching data processing pipeline (extraction, transformations, loading, monitoring).

## V8: A CCTV (recognition) + video analysis (search+reports) system for cityâ€™s police department.

## V9: Elastic computing/data processing platform Hadoop/Spark-style.
